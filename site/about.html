    <h3>üèï About Textcamp</h3>
    <p>
        The lofty ambition of Textcamp is to create text-based adventure games that
        can be enjoyed by <em>everyone</em>, <em>everywhere</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's break that down a little bit ...
    </p>
    <p>
        Text based adventure games are one of the earliest forms of computer games,
        dating back to the 1960s. I've been building them since I was a kid, and I
        love how such a simple concept can evoke such powerful experiences. It's like
        being able to interact with the characters and scenes in your favorite books!
    </p>
    <p>
        Another wonderful thing about text is that it's <em>accessible</em> ... but only
        to a point. Many (<em>many</em>) people around the world use assistive devices and
        software to help them see and hear the things that lots of us take for granted.
        This is one of the reasons why Textcamp is designed from the ground up to run in
        your browser instead of the specialized apps that most text based adventuring tools
        use: done right, the web is the most robust platform for delivering accessible content.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Curious to see and hear an example of how deaf players made a 20 year old text
        adventure game accessible? <a href="https://youtu.be/2olj9m2eY-A">Check
            out this very cool video of a boss battle</a> ... then come back!)
    </p>
    <p>
        The other reason Textcamp is on the web is because the web is <em>everywhere</em>.
        I want to be able to play on Textcamp from my phone, my laptop ... heck, even my TV!
        This brings up another challenge: typing on a phone is slow and prone to errors,
        and it's nightmare to "type" anything substantive from your TV remote.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we start thinking beyond a basic keyboard interface for text based games, we
        also open the doors to players with limited motor control, where typing on a
        full sized keyboard may not be possible. To make Textcamp available to <em>everyone,
            everywhere</em>, a player needs to be able to tap or click on words to trigger
        commands and events in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        The development of Textcamp is open to all who want to contribute. The game engine
        is <a href="https://github.com/textcamp/textcamp">100% open source</a>, and down
        the road, I hope to offer a low cost hosting service that allows <em>anyone</em>,
        not just software engineers, to build and share their games with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's next? I'm just getting started, and I'd love to get your help with
        testing and feedback ‚Äî especially if you're well versed with web accessibility.
